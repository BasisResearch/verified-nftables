# THEOREMS.md — the claim surface, mapped

What exactly is proved, by which theorem, under which evaluator, and is it
axiom-free — without reading 3000 lines of `Correct.v`.

- Machine-checked entry-point restatements: [`theories/Compiler/Main.v`](theories/Compiler/Main.v)
  (each followed by `Print Assumptions`).  Main.v also carries the
  **pre-split ratchet corollaries** (`pre_split_*`): every pre-state-split
  headline statement — which quantified over ONE packet record bundling the
  shared world — restated over the bundled pair `Packet.pstate`
  (`ps_env`/`ps_wire`), each an `exact`/`apply` of its post-split successor.
- Axiom gate: `make axioms` re-checks every HEADLINE theorem below (plus the
  supporting strata, `Elab.elab_matchcond_correct`, the representation
  ratchet `Semantics.run_rule_outcome_eq`, **and every result the README
  claims axiom-free** — anti-spoofing, established-accept, NAT-masquerade,
  multi-address, fib host-local, ct-state; see §4) from the compiled `.vo`
  files and fails on anything but `Closed under the global context`.
- Classes used below:
  - **HEADLINE** — the single top theorem of a verified axis; what the project claims.
  - **STAGE** — a per-pass/per-stage theorem composed into a headline.
  - **SUPPORTING** — a stratum or bridge a headline is derived from (or that
    scopes one); not independently a claim.
  - **SUPERSEDED** — kept for history; subsumed by a successor named in its marker.
  - **DEMO** — an executable regression pin / witness (`Example` in the source);
    not part of the claim surface.
- Where things live: `theories/` is split by trust role — `Core/` (bytes,
  verdict, packet, bytecode), `IR/` (rule IR + typed view + elaboration),
  `Semantics/`, `Compiler/` (compiler, strata, `Main.v`, extraction),
  `Optimizer/` (+ `Optimizer/Witness/` fires-witnesses), `Regression/`
  (invariant-named kernel-behaviour gates), `Examples/` (worked
  per-configuration proofs), `Generated/` (`nft2coq` output).  See
  `DEVELOPMENT.md` § "What exists" for the full table.

## 1. The entry points — exactly one top theorem per verified axis

| axis | HEADLINE theorem | file | what it says |
|---|---|---|---|
| compiler (rulesets/hooks) | `compile_hook_correct` | `Correct.v` | compiled hook dispatch (jump/goto/return, user chains, multi-table, priority order) = DSL `eval_hook`, for every fuel/ruleset/hook/packet/environment |
| compiler, sequence form | `compile_seq_correct` | `Correct.v` | the same, lifted over a packet sequence under an **arbitrary step** `verdict -> env -> env` — a per-packet **congruence corollary** of `compile_hook_correct`, *not* a proof about ruleset-generated state (that is the next axis) |
| mutation / cross-packet learning | `compile_seq_mut_correct` | `Correct.v` | compiled single-chain traversal threading the env each packet LEAVES (meta/ct writes, dynset learning) = DSL sequence, under `mut_wf` well-formedness |
| optimizer pipeline | `optimize_table_uncond_compile_correct` | `Optimize_Uncond.v` | the shipped 18-stage `nft -o` pipeline + compilation preserves every packet's verdict against the synthesised declarations, for **any input chain** (no `rules_clean`, no freshness precondition) |
| typed source elaboration | `elab_matchcond_correct` | `Elab.v` | the typed source-match layer (`Elab.tmatch`: typed immediates, CIDR-with-plen, ifname wildcards) elaborates onto the byte IR **evaluation-exactly**, for every match/env/packet — generated sources (`*_Gen.v`) carry typed terms whose meaning is the byte IR's by this theorem |

Scope notes (each also sits on the theorem in the source):

- The optimizer headline is **per chain**: quantified over a single chain and
  all environments/packets. Multi-chain/hook preservation is the separate
  `compile_ruleset_correct`/`compile_hook_correct` family — **not composed
  with the optimizer**.
- The optimizer headline is **verdict-only**: quantified over `eval_chain`,
  the write-blind/NAT-blind/jump-free evaluator — even though stages rewrite
  write-effectful statements (`datamap` folds `meta mark set`, `dnat`/`snat`
  fold NAT terminals) whose effects later hooks observe. The per-stage effect
  certificates (`Optimize_DataMap.eval_rules_mut_map_merge`,
  `Optimize_Dnat.apply_nat_dnat_eq`, snat forms) are **per-merge-shape lemmas,
  not composed through `optimize_table`** — no theorem lifts the pipeline to
  `eval_chain_mut`/`eval_rules_trace`. The full statement of the gap and the
  not-lifted rationale sit on `optimize_table_uncond_compile_correct`
  (Optimize_Uncond.v, "Scope note 2").
- The compiler axis (jump strand) threads **no writes**; the mutation axis
  follows **no jumps**. **Mutation × jump/goto is not jointly verified** (see
  the evaluator matrix, §3).

Known-gaps note: three **confirmed model-vs-kernel divergences** (limiter
sweep past a failing match; `OVmapNat` vmap-hit trace NAT + spurious `e_nat`
store; intra-rule set-then-read) hold **inside** the theorems above — DSL and
VM agree on them, so no compile theorem is weakened, but the *model* is not
kernel-exact there. Ledger with kernel citations, repros, and `vm_compute`
lock-in pins: `DEVELOPMENT.md` § "Known model infidelities" +
`theories/Regression/Known_Infidelities.v`.

## 2. Classification of every `Theorem`/`Corollary` in `Correct.v` and `Optimize*.v`

## 3. The evaluator matrix

Nine DSL entry points (`Semantics.v`) have **disjoint** feature coverage.
Every evaluator takes the shared mutable world as an explicit `env` argument
(`eval : … -> env -> packet -> …`); an evaluator that "returns env" hands back
the world it LEAVES (`… -> option verdict * env`), so the signature shows the
state flow — but not which features an evaluator silently drops.  Rows are the
entry points; every "no" cell names the bridging theorem that relates the
evaluator to the one that does cover the feature, or says `no bridging
theorem`.

| entry point | threads writes | returns env | jump/goto/return | NAT effect | multi-chain |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `eval_rules` (+`eval_chain`) | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — bridge `eval_rules_jumpfree_eq_j` (= `eval_rules_j` on jump-free rules) | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — bridge `eval_chain_eq_table_jumpfree` (jump-free chains) |
| `eval_rules_mut` (+`eval_chain_mut`) | **yes** (`dsl_rule_step`) | no — bridge `eval_rules_mut_env_fst` / `eval_chain_mut_env_fst` (`eval_rules_mut` = `fst` of `eval_rules_mut_env`) | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — bridge `eval_rules_trace_verdict` (trace verdict = mut verdict unless `trace_nat_drops`) | no — *no bridging theorem* |
| `eval_rules_mut_env` (+`eval_chain_mut_env`) | **yes** | **yes** | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* |
| `eval_rules_trace` (+`eval_chain_trace`) | **yes** | **yes** (returns `env * packet`; `chain_out`) | no — *no bridging theorem* | **yes** (`apply_nat`, `trace_nat_drops`; known infidelity: fires on an `OVmapNat` vmap **hit** too — see the ledger) | no — *no bridging theorem* (chains composed manually via `chain_out`) |
| `eval_rules_j` / `eval_table` | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* | **yes** (fuel-bounded) | no — *no bridging theorem* | **user chains** (jump targets) |
| `eval_ruleset` | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* | **yes** (via `eval_table`) | no — *no bridging theorem* | **base chains** across tables |
| `eval_hook` | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* | **yes** | no — *no bridging theorem* | **hook dispatch** (priority-ordered) |
| `seq_eval` | no — the between-packet step is external/arbitrary; *no bridging theorem* | threaded between packets (by `step`) | **yes** (instantiated with `eval_hook`) | no — *no bridging theorem* | **yes** (via `eval_hook`) |
| `seq_eval_env` | **yes** (instantiated with `eval_chain_mut_env`) | threaded between packets (by the evaluator itself) | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* | no — *no bridging theorem* |

**Mutation × jump/goto is not jointly verified**: no evaluator both threads
writes and follows jumps, and no theorem relates the mutation strand
(`eval_rules_mut*`, `eval_rules_trace`, `seq_eval_env`) to the jump strand
(`eval_rules_j`/`eval_table`/`eval_ruleset`/`eval_hook`/`seq_eval`). A
`meta mark set` inside a jump target is out of scope of every theorem above.
Note the mutation theorems themselves carry **no jump-freedom hypothesis** —
they are unconditional DSL=VM agreement facts that DO instantiate on a
jump-bearing chain, where both sides treat the realised `Jump`/`Goto` as a
(kernel-wrong) fall-through; the faithful domain is delimited by prose + the
pin `Correct.mut_strand_jump_pin`, not in-theorem. Why a `chain_jumpfree`
hypothesis was deliberately NOT added (it would shrink the agreement facts'
domain without making any chain faithful; no jump-aware *mutating* evaluator
exists to bridge to; `chain_jumpfree` is defined at the fixed entry state and
would need a step-threaded redefinition): the rationale block on the mutation
strata in `Correct.v` (before the fidelity bridge).

The bytecode VM mirrors the DSL rows one-for-one (`run_rule(s)`,
`run_program(_mut,_mut_env)`, `run_rules_j`/`run_table`, `run_ruleset`); each
compile theorem in §2 equates one DSL row with its VM mirror.  The VM mirror of
the `fst` bridge is `run_program_mut_env_fst` / `run_chain_mut_env_fst`.

Every mutation/trace evaluator consumes a single per-rule STEP function —
`dsl_rule_step` (DSL) / `vm_rule_step` (VM), each returning the pair
(loadability-guarded verdict, `(env, packet)` left: writes + limiter
consumption; the `numgen inc` counter advance is **VM-side only** —
`vm_rule_step` composes `numgen_sweep_prog`, `dsl_rule_step` deliberately has
no numgen sweep, and `mut_wf`'s `rule_numgen_free` conjunct makes the VM sweep
the identity on the theorems' whole domain, so numgen-inc rules — which no
parser can produce — are outside every mutation theorem and the round-robin
behaviour `Regression/Numgen_RoundRobin.v` pins is not compiler-preserved;
rationale on `Semantics.dsl_step`).  The DSL/VM agreement obligation is the one equation
`vm_rule_step_compile_rule : mut_wf r = true -> vm_rule_step (compile_rule r) e p
= dsl_rule_step r e p` (`Correct.v`).  `mut_wf` itself lives in the Semantics
stratum (`Semantics.mut_wf`; `Correct.v` re-exports it as an abbreviation) and
is stated entirely on the source AST: its numgen conjunct is the syntactic
`rule_numgen_free` (`Semantics.v`), which equals the bytecode-side
`numgen_free_prog (compile_rule r)` by `Correct.numgen_free_compile_rule` (the
old-shape hypothesis is restored verbatim by `Correct.mut_wf_prog_eq`).
Because it is source-side, the hypothesis is **discharged at the tool
boundary**: `Semantics.mut_wf` is extracted, `make parse-test` asserts
`forallb mut_wf` over every chain of the four shipped rulesets (build failure
on violation), and the `nftc` CLI warns — naming this axis — on any parsed
chain that violates it.

## 4. Axiom-freedom gates

- **`make axioms` is the build-FAILING gate** (`AXIOM_GATE_THEOREMS`,
  proof/Makefile): `Print Assumptions` over 41 theorems, failing on anything
  but `Closed under the global context`.  The list is
  - the HEADLINE set (§1) + the `Correct.v` strata + the optimizer DSL form +
    `Elab.elab_matchcond_correct` + the representation ratchet
    `Semantics.run_rule_outcome_eq` (12 theorems), and
  - **every result the README claims axiom-free** (README § "Headline
    guarantees are axiom-free", 29 theorems): anti-spoofing
    (`Optiplex_Antispoof.antispoof_general` + its 3 concrete corollaries),
    established-accept (`Example_Ruleset.established_accepted`),
    NAT-masquerade / multi-address primary selection
    (`Netstate_MultiAddr.masq_saddr_is_selected_primary`,
    `masq_drop_iff_no_eligible_addr`), fib host-local (all 17 `Fib_Local`
    heads), and ct-state (all 5 `Ct_State` theorems).

  The rule: **any result the README (or this file) presents as a claim is in
  `AXIOM_GATE_THEOREMS`, in the same commit that adds the claim.**
  Classification note: several of these live in `Examples/`/`Regression/` and
  are DEMO-class *within their axis derivation maps* (executable pins), but
  as README claim surface they are gated exactly like HEADLINEs — the gate
  follows the claim, not the file's directory.
- The in-file `Print Assumptions` lines (end of `Correct.v`,
  `Optimize_Uncond.v`, all of `Main.v`, `Fib_Local.v`, `Ct_State.v`,
  `Optiplex_Antispoof.v`, `Netstate_MultiAddr.v`, `Example_Ruleset.v`, …) are
  **informational**: they print a verdict into the `make proofs` build log
  for eyeball checks, but a `Print Assumptions` cannot fail a build and no CI
  greps that log.  The mechanical stop against an `Admitted` or a
  section-variable leak entering a claimed result is `make axioms` (run by
  the `make gates` aggregate).  The `pre_split_*` ratchet corollaries in
  `Main.v` carry in-file prints and are each an `exact`/`apply` of a gated
  theorem, so their assumption sets coincide with gated ones.
- One-liner (the historical gate):
  `cd theories && printf 'From Nft Require Import Correct Optimize.\nPrint Assumptions compile_chain_correct.\n' | coqtop -R . Nft`
  → `Closed under the global context`.

## 6. Representation ratchets (M4)

Representation changes ship with an in-kernel equivalence to the shape they
replaced:

| change | ratchet |
|---|---|
| rule outcome: 1 verdict + 5 optional slots -> `Syntax.outcome` sum | `Semantics.run_rule_outcome_eq`: for every well-formed product (`Syntax.prod_wf`), `outcome (rule_of_prod rp) = outcome_prod rp` on all env/packets (`outcome_prod` is the pre-sum evaluation, verbatim, over the historical record `Syntax.rule_prod`) |
| typed source matches (`Elab.tmatch`) over the byte IR | `Elab.elab_matchcond_correct` (evaluation-exact elaboration); byte-faithfulness of the typed encodings: `Nftval.encode_*` vm_compute witnesses + `Elab.prefix_aligned_24`/`prefix_unaligned_20`/`elab_port_22`/`elab_wildcard` |
| `MMasked` polarity bool -> `cmpop` | the eval clause is `eval_cmp op` (the VM's own comparator); `MFlagsSet` names the positive implicit-bitmask idiom (`(field & X) <> 0`, `CNe`) |
| `nat_kind`/`nat_family`/dynset-op strings -> `Bytecode.nat_op`/`nat_af`/`dynset_op` | rendering strings exist only at the codec/netlink boundary (extracted/codec.ml, nl_send.ml); `make corpus` (2532/2532) pins the rendered bytes unchanged |
| `BDep` dependency tag | a *definitional alias* of `BMatch` (`Syntax.BDep`): evaluation, loadability, compilation are those of the match it wraps, definitionally |
